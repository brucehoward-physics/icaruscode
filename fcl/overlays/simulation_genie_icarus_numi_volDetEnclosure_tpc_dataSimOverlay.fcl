# Purpose: Simulation of neutrinos from NuMI on a single ICARUS cryostat.
# Date:    August 3, 2021
# Version: 1.0
#
# Run Genie with the "volDetEnclosure" TopVolume, which makes neutrinos in
# both cryostats. Also turn on the fiducial cut to filter the interactions
# outside a box covering the TPC's in both cryostats. The only remaining 
# inefficiency is the gap between the two cryostats

# mbox is set as "xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax"
# Add 10cm on side of each dimmension for some wiggle
#
# Because this is hardcoded, it needs to be updated for 
# updates to the geometry. This is updates as of
