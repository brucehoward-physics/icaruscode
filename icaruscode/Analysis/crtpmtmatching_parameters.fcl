  #  Beam Gate and inBeam gate parameters were evaluated from the BNB and NuMI plots
  #  reported in DocDB-30190 slides 17 (BNB) and 19 (NuMI).
  #  Note1: in the plots a 500 ns offset was added to have start of the gate right at 0.
  #  Note2: the inBeam parameters were determined experimentally by selecting the beam
  #  excess time window. At the current state of the CRTPMT filter, the requirement to
  #  have the optical flashes within the BeamExcess time window is not applied.
